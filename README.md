#Connected Squares
HI!

This repository is just for fun, the main goal is to find if the top wall and the lower wall of a random generated maze is connected somehow, this way the maze has at least one solution.

if you want to see the repository in action please [click here](https://chamoysvoice.github.io/connected-squares) and press F5 to generate new instances

the connected group of walls are colored in blue BTW :)

It is brute force right now, proper algorithms will be used in the future :v
